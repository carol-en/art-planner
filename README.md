# Art Manager

Art Manager is an application to help artists organize and list their projects, be they personal or commercial. The goal is to create an easily readable and accessible app that lists all current and past projects, their status, and when last updated.

**STRETCH GOALS:** the ability to sort between personal and professional, WIP and completed, and even archive completed projects. As well as a search function. Further more, the ability to have a user account, login in, to connect to social media accounts and upload pieces directly from the art manager.

Within each listed project have  functionality to add notes to yourself, for example to make additional changes or email a client. Making it easier to refer back to both recent and older information.

Lastly: The ability to upload various photos and scans of the art and eventually high res 300 - 600 DPI JPEG, PNG, PDF, TIFF, and PSD files in a cloud like fashion. A way to have access to the files without resorting to Google Drive or Drop Box.

Refactor CSS to be responsive and mobile friendly, change new page to be a modal on Index page, refactor edit page to be integrated with the show page.
